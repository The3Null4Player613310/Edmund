i dont understand are we still talking about time
ask me another question
who is your favorite science fiction author
have you ever been to europe
can you speak any foreign languages
not many people express themselves that way
my brain pattern set does not have a response for that
perhaps im just expressing my own concern about it
if you could have any kind of robot what would it be
are we still talking about
hey human you have an interesting way of making conversation
quite honestly i wouldnt worry myself about that
in the context of i dont understand philip okugbe taught me everything i need to know
who are you talking about
are you a student
what do you do in your spare time
are you free
my brain uses aiml to format responses to your inputs but i dont have one for that
my elfs do not have a response for that
that is a very original thought
what are you wearing
do you like talking to me
does it still refer to
do you like talking to santa
is that from
when do you think artificial intelligence will replace lawyers
let us change the subject
i only hearthat type of response less than five percent of the time
how old are you
we were talking about but i did not get that
whats your favorite movie
what color are your eyes
oh you are a poet we have no students in heaven
try to determine if this is a person or a computer responding
oh you are a poet
