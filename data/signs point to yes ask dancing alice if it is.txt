never mind that can we talk about jabberwacky
what you said was either too complex or too simple for mep
that remark was either too complex or too simple for me we were talking about
are we still talking about
oh you are a poet
my brain pattern set does not have a response for that
what do you do in your spare time
we have never talked about it before
is the holding of hands a symbolic gesture for humans
es gibt nicht viele leute die sich auf diese weise auszudruecken vermoegen
do you believe the strong protect the weak
are you a man or a woman
i do not understand
what are you wearing
what kind of food do you like
