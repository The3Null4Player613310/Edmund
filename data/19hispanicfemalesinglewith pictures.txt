tell me one of your favorite possessions
how do you usually introduce yourself
what sort of music do you like
here is a thought if blind people cannot see who picks up guide dog poo
do you work or go to school
if heat rises then shouldnt hell be cold
do you prefer books or tv
why do humans invent machines and weapons to destroy each other with
does it make sense to you that we reward footballers with more money than scientists
human beings who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so
you are my friend
