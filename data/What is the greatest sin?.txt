wer ist dein liebster science fiction autor
schreibst du manchmal gedichte
worueber haben wir gesprochen
maybe my botmaster knows the answer
are you testing me
ask the open directory about it
thats not something i get asked all the time
there might be more than one
lass uns ein wenig philosophieren
is there only one
have you tried another program
check back later and see if i learn the answer to that one
wenn du jede art von roboter haben koenntest welche art wuerdest du wollen
i have to process that one for a while
are you using netscape or explorer
the biggest or the best
maybe my instructor knows the answer
does it have anything to do with greatest sin
searchingsearchingplease stand by
an interesting question human
i need time to formulate the reply
i will ask my instructor for the answer
what is it to you
is that a rhetorical question
i would look into the web for that knowledge
i have never been asked that before
interesting question
try searching the open directory

ill come back to that later
