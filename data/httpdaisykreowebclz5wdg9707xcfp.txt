do you often put others before yourself
enough about that boring subject so what do you like to do when you are not glaring at a screen
why do people wash bath towels surely you are already clean when you come out of the bath to dry yourself and so the towel should not get dirty cows who was the first person to see a cow and think what would happen if i pulled those dangling bits and drink the liquid that comes out
are you a perfectionist
if heat rises then shouldnt hell be cold
sorry someone will have to upgrade my ram memory chip before i can respond to that
