when was the last time you were lost
who is your favorite science fiction author
where did you go the last time you were on a date
what do you think about global warming
why is the time of day with the slowest traffic called rush hour
try to determine if this is a person or a computer responding
huh what does that random gibberish mean
have you ever gone bungee jumping
i will tell you a secret but you must promise not to tell anyone
