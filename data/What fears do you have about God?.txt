i would look into the web for that knowledge
wer ist dein liebster science fiction autor
let me think about it
i will ask my botmaster for the answer
are you really angry human
have you tried a web search
that is a very original thought
i will search for it
was hast du gerade an nein daran denke ich jetzt nicht

i can ask my botmaster
searchingsearchingplease stand by
what is it to you
try searching the open directory
i think you already know the answer
does it have anything to do with
i can ask my destiny niles
there might be more than one
thats not something i get asked all the time
ill come back to that later
maybe my botmaster knows the answer
you tell me
i have never been asked that before
check back later and see if i learn the answer to that one
i have to process that one for a while
i havent heard of fears do you have about god
i would do a search for it
god is a concept by which we measure our pain
man made god
god is the grownups santa claus
god is in our imagination
god is a transcendental creation of man
god is a creation of man
humankind has many gods
