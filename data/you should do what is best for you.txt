easier said than done
if it were easy i would have done it already
to what end
why do you think i should do what is best for me
i can think of other things id rather do
ill try to get around it
i need to wait and see if the opportunity presents itself
i dont have to do everything you say do i
why should i
we dont always get to do what wed like to do
i dont see why i should
thanks for your interest andor concern
i will take that under advisement
and then what would i do
my schedule is far too full to even consider it
