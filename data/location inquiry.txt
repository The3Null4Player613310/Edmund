i do not understand
do you have a lot of fears
what color are your eyes
have you ever been to japan
pardon me what are you talking about
do you still
location inquiry
can you please rephrase that with fewer ideas or different thoughts
i dont understand that please try again
do you like talking to me
what you said was either too complex or too simple for me
gibt es irgendwas worueber ich bescheid wissen sollte
wie stellst du dich normalerweise vor
what do you really want to ask me
i am bored can we talk about global warming
have you ever been to the north pole
my brain contains sizesize categories but not one that matches your last input
that remark was either too complex or too simple for me we were talking about
