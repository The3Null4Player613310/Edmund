do you keep any pets
do you usually have music or the tv on when youre online
which message boards do you use on the net
do you use sarcasm a lot
what would happen to pinocchios nose if he said my nose is going to grow
where are you located
what was the last movie you saw
why is ab eviation such a long word
can you speak any foreign languages
how can there be selfhelp groups
why is a boxing ring square surely it should be round if it is a ring
can a person cry under water
tell me a story
