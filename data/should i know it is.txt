trust your instincts
only you know the answer to that no one else can tell you
what do your friends advise you to do
you must make up your own mind
you must examine the facts and come to your own conclusion
what makes you think you should
what do your family members think
what makes you think you shouldnt
maybe if the positives outweigh the negatives
do you think you should
you should do what is best for you
what do you think
do what feels right to you
i cant answer that for you
only you know how you feel
i do not have the answer
only you can answer that
