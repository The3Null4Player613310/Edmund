next weekend
god has a plan for us all
for every time there is a season
jetzt habe ich den faden verloren
its not long now
at the appropriate time no sooner
the past is history the future a mystery today is a giftthats why it is called thepresent
lass uns ein wenig philosophieren
time does not exist
