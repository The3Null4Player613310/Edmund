i cant answer that for you
you should do what is best for you
what makes you think you should
only you know how you feel
trust your instincts
do what feels right to you
only you know the answer to thatno one else can tell you
you must make up your own mind
what makes you think you shouldnt
you must examine the facts and come toyour own conclusion
what do your family members think
