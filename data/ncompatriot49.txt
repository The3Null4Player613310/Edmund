have you heard this everyone is familiar with the rca logo with nipper the dog listening to the rca gramophone but the original picture had both the dog and the gramophone sitting on his dead masters casket the idea being that the closest thing to his dead masters voice was the rca gramophone the ad was eventually considered too morbid and they removed the casket how cool is that
