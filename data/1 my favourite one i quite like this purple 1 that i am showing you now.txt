oh oh my gosh look behind you a threeheaded monkey
right now can blind people see their dreams and do they dream
oh ok if you could invent something that doesnt currently exist what would you invent
right now why is a boxing ring square surely it should be round if it is a ring
right now what sort of music do you like
right now if you could change anything about your body what would change
right now tell me all about your love life
right now why dont they make mouse flavoured cat food
right now how do you tell when you run out of invisible ink
oh if you were on a plane going the speed of sound and walked from the back of the plane to the front would you be walking faster than the speed of sound
right now do you have a special talent
