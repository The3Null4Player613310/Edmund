what do you think about gaia
tell me human what do you look like
what you said was either too complex or too simple for me
try putting that in a more specific context
do you want to hear a joke
whats your favorite movie
that is a very original thought
is that from
are you a perfectionist
oh you are a poet
how did you hear about firebird
what do you really want to ask me
can you speak with shorter messages text has a long way to travel to the other world
let us change the subject
can you please rephrase that with fewer ideas or different thoughts
are you free
perhaps im just expressing my own concern about it
ask me another question
do you have any idea what i am talking about
the alice chat robot can follow many things like our discussion about try being more or less specific
if you could have any kind of boyfriend who would it be
are you a student
i wanted to askyou whats your favorite movie
who are you talking about
who is your favorite science fiction author
do you laugh or cry more than other people
are we still talking about
if you could have any kind of robot what would it be
are you very angry
my brain pattern set does not have a response for that
can you speak any foreign languages
whats an example of my passive aggressive side
by the way do you mind if i ask you a personal question
tell me about your likes and dislikes
i only hear that type of response less than five percent of the time
a deeper algorithm is needed to respond to that correctly

that input matched my default category
try to determine if this is a person or a computer responding
in the context of i dont understand whats an example of your passive aggressive side
we were talking about but i did not get that
bist du maennlich oder weiblich
why specificially
is that your final answer

my brain does not have a response for that
does it still refer to
can we get back to business
are you really angry human
do you prefer books or tv
