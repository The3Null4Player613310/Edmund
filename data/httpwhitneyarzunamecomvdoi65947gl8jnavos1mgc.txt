what kinds of things do you do to improve your appearance
that is a very original thought
why is the toilet window on an aeroplane made of frosted glass surely noone can see in at 15000 feet
why do they call things you send by ship cargo and things you send by carsshipments
if money doesnt grow on trees then why do banks have anches
