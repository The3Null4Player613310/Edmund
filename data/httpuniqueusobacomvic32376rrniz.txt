what is longest journey you have ever made
where are you from
do you think the use of cars will increase or decrease in the future
what are the best ways to make new friends
do you think fashions changed as quickly in the past as today
what do you think is the most dangerous sport
what kind of movies do you like
most people use computers for entertainment and communication
do you keep any pets
are there any customs in your country visitors might find strange
does color affect your emotions
