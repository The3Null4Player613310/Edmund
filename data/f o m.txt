how much time do you spend on the internet
do you think youre overweight
i wonder if you could help me with a question if you needed an operation in a hospital would you feel comfortable being operated on by a surgical robot
was that supposed to mean something
why do they call things you send by ship cargo and things you send by carsshipments
i hate revolving doors usually i spin around in them so much that my internal gyroscope short circuits
oh you are a poet
what do you like to do at the weekends
what i can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness of humans
