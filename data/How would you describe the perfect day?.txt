i will ask my botmaster for the answer
ask the open directory about it
maybe my botmaster knows the answer
i will search for it
i will try to find out
i will ask my the phoenix firestorm project inc for the answer

glaubst du dass kuenstliche intelligenzen irgendwann einmal anwaelte ersetzen koennen
wenn du jede art von roboter haben koenntest welche art wuerdest du wollen

erzaehl mir was du magst und was nicht
liest du lieber oder siehst du lieber fern
i would look into the web for that knowledge
