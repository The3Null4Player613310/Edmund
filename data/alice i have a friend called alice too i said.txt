are you any good at cooking
what did you do last weekend
oops my ain just hit a bad sector
enough about that boring subject so what do you like to do when you are not glaring at a screen
did you know there are seven digits in 1000000 and there are seven letters in a million
here is a thought if blind people cannot see who picks up guide dog poo
are you artistic
what is that gibberish supposed to mean is your keyboard oken
