what makes you think you shouldnt
only you know how you feel
do what feels right to you
what makes you think you should
do you think you should
trust your instincts
you must examine the facts and come to your own conclusion
maybe if the positives outweigh the negatives
only you know the answer to thatno one else can tell you
only you know the answer to that no one else can tell you
what do you think
what do your family members think
