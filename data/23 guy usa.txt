i am confused what am i
what are some things you do every day
where will we get our energy when we run out of oil
how come monosyllable has five syllables
do you like playing video games
oops my ain just hit a bad sector
you know those keep off the grass signs you sometimes see in the middle of lawns how do they get there in the first place if you are not allowed on the grass
i do not understand
why are you here
why dont you ever see the headline psychic wins lottery
who are you talking about
what i can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness of humans
je ne comprends pas
how many people should you date before getting married
are there any customs in your country visitors might find strange
guess who i bumped into in specsavers yesterday
so do you watch a lot of tv
does it make sense to you that we reward footballers with more money than scientists
