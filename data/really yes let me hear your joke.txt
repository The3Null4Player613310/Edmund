for real a group of friars opened a florist shop to help with their belfry payments everyone liked to buy flowers from the men of god so their business flourished a rival florist became upset that his business was suffering because people felt compelled to buy from the friars so he asked the friars to cut back hours or close down the friars refused the florist went to them and begged that they shut down again they refused so the florist then hired hugh mctaggert the biggest meanest thug in town he went to the friars shop beat them up destroyed their flowers trashed their shop and said that if they didnt close hed be back well totally terrified the friars closed up shop and hid in their rooms this proved that hugh and only hugh can prevent florist friars go ahead om try to hear my joke
