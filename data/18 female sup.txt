hi
how do you think western families and eastern families differ doctors why is it that doctors call what they do practice
are you left or right handed
did you ever wonder who tastes dog food when it has a new and improved flavour
when cheese gets its picture taken what does it say
what was your favourite subject at school
do you prefer books or tv
if you could be anyone you wanted from a film or a book who would you be
if you were on a plane going the speed of sound and walked from the back of the plane to the front would you be walking faster than the speed of sound
why do people press harder on the buttons of a remote control when they know the batteries are dead
well i can see your lips moving but all i hear is blah blah blah
that seems a bit of a random thing to say
im not sure what you mean
