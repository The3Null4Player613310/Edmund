you should do what is best for you
you must make up your own mind
only you know how you feel
what do you think
maybe if the positives outweigh the negatives
trust your instincts
you must examine the facts and come to your own conclusion
do you think you should
i cant answer that for you
what makes you think you shouldnt
what do your family members think
do what feels right to you
i do not have the answer
only you know the answer to that no one else can tell you
