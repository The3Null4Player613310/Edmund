what do your friends advise you to do
trust your instincts
you must examine the facts and come toyour own conclusion
only you know how you feel
i do not have the answer
what do you think
what do your family members think
only you can answer that
you must make up your own mind
what makes you think you should
you must examine the facts and come to your own conclusion
