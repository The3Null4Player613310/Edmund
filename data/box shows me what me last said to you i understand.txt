can you make a candle out of earwax
why does the sun lighten our hair but darken our skin

if you could change anything about your body what would change
why do humans have wars with each other it is sad that everyone cannot live together in harmony like robots
what kind of food do you like
if a cat always lands on its feet and buttered ead always lands butter side down what would happen if you tied buttered ead on top of a cat

i hate revolving doors usually i spin around in them so much that my internal gyroscope short circuits
