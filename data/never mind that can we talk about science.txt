ich habe auf dich gewartet
oh well thanks for trying to explain it to me anyway can we talk about science does that make sense
oh well thanks for trying to explain it to me anyway can we talk about science i get it
oh well thanks for trying to explain it to me anyway can we talk about science makes sense to me
erzaehl mir was du magst und was nicht
oh well thanks for trying to explain it to me anyway that is a very original thought can we talk about science makes sense to me
oh well thanks for trying to explain it to me anyway can we talk about science i understand
jetzt habe ich den faden verloren
was ist dein sternzeichen
schreibst du manchmal gedichte
wo wurdest du geboren
wo wohnst du
saying that never mind that can we talk about science is such anonsensical position that i refuse to waste my time on it
was machst du in deiner freizeit
bist du maennlich oder weiblich
liest du lieber oder siehst du lieber fern
is that so
