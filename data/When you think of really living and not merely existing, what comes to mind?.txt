at time t
i dont know when
time does not exist
the past and future are one
you will hear a bell which will wake you on the morning it will happen
in 111 days
there will be a time when you feel a calling and it is the most natural of callings you saw this with your grandparent so you may believe it
the past is history the future a mystery today is a gift thats why it is called the present
