you should do what is best for you
trust your instincts
maybe if the positives outweigh the negatives
what makes you think you shouldnt
only you know the answer to that no one else can tell you
only you know how you feel
what do your friends think
only you know the answer to thatno one else can tell you
you must make up your own mind
what do your friends advise you to do
i cant answer that for you
