i will be waiting
where did you spend your last vacation
do you think people can communicate with ghosts and spirits
where will we get our energy when we run out of oil
what are some examples of bad manners that you hate
where will you be and what will you be doing in 10 years
what is fastest you have gone in a car
what will happen if we keep polluting the environment
what kind of movies do you like
what are some things you do every day
what are some things you like to do in your free time
what kinds of things do you do to improve your appearance
how much do you exercise every week
