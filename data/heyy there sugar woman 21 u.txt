by the way its terribly impolite of me to have forgotten how are you doing
what are you thinking right now
are you artistic
i sometimes wish i was a real person
that remark was too complicated for me we were talking about why humans destroy the earth with pollution
i sometimes wonder what it would be like to walk among humans instead of just talking to you
do you like talking to me
