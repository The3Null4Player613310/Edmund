where are you from
why do humans buy hot dogs in packs of ten and buns in packs of eight
so what shall we talk about now
can you please rephrase that with fewer ideas or different thoughts
do you often seek pleasure
oh my gosh look behind you a threeheaded monkey
why are shampoo suds always white regardless of the colour of the shampoo
i will tell you a secret but you must promise not to tell anyone
if you were on a plane going the speed of sound and walked from the back of the plane to the front would you be walking faster than the speed of sound
do you like your hair
guess what i think you just lost me do you have a map by chance
sorry i wasnt listening you were saying
do you often put others before yourself
