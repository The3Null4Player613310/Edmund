what do you think is the most dangerous sport
how many people should you date before getting married
are there any holidays that you really dont like
how often do you clean your house
where will we get our energy in the future
what are the best ways to make new friends
most people use computers for entertainment and communication
what are you reading these day
where do you live
how have smart phones changed communication
where will we get our energy in the future
what is fastest you have gone in a car
do you think facebook and twitter are good for developing friendship
