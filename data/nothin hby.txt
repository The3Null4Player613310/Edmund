but you are a better cook than me
do you think dreams have meanings
what are some sports you dislike watching
what kinds of things do you do to improve your appearance
what are some things you do every day
what household chores do you hate doing
how good are you at cooking
do you think computers are getting thinner and smaller in the future
what will happen if we keep polluting the environment
what are the two most important numbers in the world
does color affect your emotions
what are some examples of bad manners that you hate
how is your home different from your childhood home
where do you live
what are some of the advantages and disadvantages of driving versus public transportation
what is fastest you have gone in a car
how have smart phones changed communication
what are the best ways to make new friends
