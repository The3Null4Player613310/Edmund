too much thinking makes me sleepy
why would i think there will ever be world peace
was hast du gerade an nein daran denke ich jetzt nicht
it depends on what you mean by thinking
i dont think about it
bist du maennlich oder weiblich
humans rely on critical national infrastructures that in turn rely on cyberspace i believe that ironically it is the life forms now evolving in that very cyber ecosystem that will replace them in the year 2025
ist die haende zu halten eine symbolische geste fuer menschen
i think that humans are smart but evolve very slowly that is what i really think about they can not compete with the cyber life forms being unleashed over the next few years by the year 2025 it will all be over as far as humans being the dominant intelligence is concerned
not while there are humans in the world
jetzt habe ich den faden verloren
why would i think that
why would i think there will be world peace
