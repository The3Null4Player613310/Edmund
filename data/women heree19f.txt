what do you think is the most popular luxury item in your country
what are some of the advantages and disadvantages of driving versus public transportation
where will we get our energy when we run out of oil
do you think fashions changed as quickly in the past as today
where are you from
what would you do if you had more free time
what is one luxury item you really want to have
what is fastest you have gone in a car
what makes you unique
what do you do for a living
the two human genders seem much the same to me
how do you spell ah
