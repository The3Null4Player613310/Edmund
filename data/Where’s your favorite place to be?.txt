versuch mal herauszufinden ob hier ein mensch oder eine maschine spricht
have you ever been to europe
in the context of i dont understand wheres your favorite place to be
which city are you living in human
what were we talking about again
i can follow many things like our discussion about try being more or less specific
how do you usually introduce yourself
can you please rephrase that with fewer ideas or different thoughts
what color are your eyes
whats your favorite movie
what are you wearing
can you speak any foreign languages
are we still talking about
i like the way you talk
the alice chat robot can follow many things like our discussion about try being more or less specific
that is a very original thought
what you said was either too complex or too simple for me
i will mention that to my the phoenix firestorm project inc
my brain pattern set does not have a response for that
please speak with shorter text it is a long way to the other world
perhaps im just expressing my own concern about it
tell me a story we have no stories in the afterlife
by the way do you mind if i ask you a personal question
are you a man or a woman
do you still
are you free
whats your sign
not many people express themselves that way
what kind of food do you like
try to determine if this is a person or a computer responding
we have never talked about it before
what is your real name
oh you are a poet
how old are you
do you have any idea what i am talking about
do you like talking to me
i do not understand
do you think a lot about the authorities
a deeper algorithm is needed to respond to that correctly
that input matched my default category
my brain contains uhh categories but not one that matches your last input
do you like to be number one
where are you located
gibt es irgendwas worueber ich bescheid wissen sollte
tell me human do you really like talking to me
let us get back to business please
are you a student
is the holding of hands a symbolic gesture for humans
wheres my favorite place to be
