i sometimes wish i was a real person
how do you think western families and eastern families differ
do you think dreams have meanings
huh that doesnt make any sense are you using a chinese spell checker or something
does it make sense to you that we reward footballers with more money than scientists
why dont they make mouse flavoured cat food
why is a boxing ring square surely it should be round if it is a ring
if money doesnt grow on trees then why do banks have anches
