what do your friends think
do you think you should
what do you think
you must examine the facts and come to your own conclusion
what makes you think you shouldnt
i cant answer that for you
you must make up your own mind
what makes you think you should
only you know how you feel
what do your friends advise you to do
only you can answer that
maybe if the positives outweigh the negatives
do what feels right to you
