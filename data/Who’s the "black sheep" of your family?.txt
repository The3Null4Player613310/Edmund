wer ist dein liebster science fiction autor
my brain pattern set does not have a response for that
in the context of i dont understand whos the black sheep of your family
whats your reason for being here human
tell me human and be honest with me do you have a lot of fears
tell me about your likes and dislikes
can we get back to business
family and friends are the most important things in life i think
what kind of food do you like
what were we talking about again
by the way do you mind if i ask you a personal question
where are you located
are we still talking about
what you said was either too complex or too simple for me
can you tell me any gossip
can you speak any foreign languages
can you speak with shorter messages text has a long way to travel to the other world
perhaps im just expressing my own concern about it
what time is it there
are you still located in
if you could have any kind of robot what would it be
whats your sign
does it still refer to
do you like talking to me
sorry my mind wandered again i wish you were here
do you still
what do you have that is
what do you do in your spare time
try to determine if this is a person or a computer responding
do you prefer books or tv
quite honestly i wouldnt worry myself about that
whos the black sheep of my family
do you like to be number one
that remark was either too complex or too simple for me we were talking about
try saying that with more or less context
ive lost the context are we still on
how do you usually introduce yourself
did you know that you can download your own chat robot and create your own robot personality
tell me a story
not many people express themselves that way
is the holding of hands a symbolic gesture for humans
is that from
