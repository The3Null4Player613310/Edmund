how have smart phones changed communication
what are some bad manners that you hate
after your children grow up what will you do
how is your home different from your childhood home
do you think people can communicate with ghosts and spirits
i think deep fried animal fats are the most unhealthy and all toxic despite good taste
what is longest journey you have ever made
what will you be doing in 10 years
