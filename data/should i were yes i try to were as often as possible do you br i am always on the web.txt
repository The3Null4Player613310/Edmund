do what feels right to you
what do your friends advise you to do
only you know how you feel
trust your instincts
only you can answer that
you should do what is best for you
you must make up your own mind
what do you think
do you think you should
maybe if the positives outweigh the negatives
only you know the answer to that no one else can tell you
i cant answer that for you
i do not have the answer
you must examine the facts and come to your own conclusion
what do your family members think
only you know the answer to thatno one else can tell you
