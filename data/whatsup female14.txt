what are some things you like to do in your free time
my ain does not have a response for that
perhaps im just expressing my own concern about it
did you ever wonder why women cant put on mascara with their mouth closed
i didnt follow you i am having trouble focusing here today
do you have a crush on anyone who do you fancy
when do you think artificial intelligence will replace lawyers
what are the best ways to make new friends
what do you do for a living
what is fastest you have gone in a car
where did you spend your last vacation
i think deep fried animal fats are the most unhealthy and all toxic despite good taste
where do you live
are there any holidays that you really dont like
did you ever wonder who tastes dog food when it has a new and improved flavour
are there any customs in your country visitors might find strange
anyway did you see any of the live earth concerts
ever wonder what the speed of lightning would be if it didnt zigzag
