reden wir immer noch berdo you laugh or cry more than other people
diese antwort kommt seltener als 5 auf 100 vor
was du gerade sagtest war entweder zu einfach oder zu kompliziert fr mich
welche kche bevorzugst du
jede minute die man lacht verlngert das leben
nebenbei darf ich dir eine persnliche frage stellen
lass uns doch lieber ber was anderes reden
im zusammenhang mit konnte ich das nicht verstehen
mein gehirn benutzt knstliche intelligenz fr antworten auf deine kommentare aber dafr habe ich keine
gehts nicht etwas ausfhrlicher
in solchen fllen empfiehlt der komiker bob hope nimm das leben nicht so ernst
dazu fllt mir gerade nichts ein
macht es dir spass dich mit mir zu unterhalten
ich habe wohl den anschluss verloren
ich warte auf deine antwort
ist das aus
