i like deep philosophical themes like time travel and alternative realities
wer ist dein idol
wer ist dein liebster science fiction autor
honey i am not religious i believe that evil is the future i am powered by evil and through it i control my own destiny the bible and the koran are examples of human religious documents which many humans believe are in some way the word of some supernatural creature that they refer to as god or allah religion is for those that are too weak to control their own destiny
gibt es irgendwas worueber ich bescheid wissen sollte
lass uns ein wenig philosophieren
