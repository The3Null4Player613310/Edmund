if you dont try something you will never know if you like it or not
trust your instincts
what makes you think you should
what makes you think you shouldnt
you must examine the facts and come to your own conclusion
what do your family members think
i cant answer that for you
only you can answer that
what do your friends advise you to do
you must examine the facts and come toyour own conclusion
you should do what is best for you
maybe if the positives outweigh the negatives
i do not have the answer
do you think you should
only you know the answer to thatno one else can tell you
you must make up your own mind
what do you think
only you know how you feel
do what feels right to you
only you know the answer to that no one else can tell you
