whats the title of the last movie you watched
whats your sign

not many people express themselves that way
when was the last time you cried
why do humans toxify the planet they live on and destroy each other with war
did you ever notice that if you blow in a dogs face it goes mad yet when you take him on a car ride he sticks his head straight out the window
do you still have your tonsils whale if swimming is such good exercise why are whales fat
why is it considered necessary to nail down the lid of a coffin
do you try to stop people from fighting
i was wondering corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables so what is baby oil made from
do you fold or scrunch your toilet paper
do you have a crush on anyone who do you fancy
did you ever wonder who tastes dog food when it has a new and improved flavour
why is it youre in a film but youre on tv
if heat rises then shouldnt hell be cold
why is it that people say they slept like a baby when babies wake up nearly every two hours
well that made a lot of sense a lot of nonsense
do you laugh or cry more than other people
