what do you think
i do not have the answer
maybe if the positives outweigh the negatives
trust your instincts
what makes you think you shouldnt
do you think you should
do what feels right to you
you must examine the facts and come to your own conclusion
only you know the answer to thatno one else can tell you
you must make up your own mind
