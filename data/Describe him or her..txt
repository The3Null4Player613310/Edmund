worueber haben wir gesprochen
you tell me
i will ask my botmaster for the answer
what is him
i dont understand can we talk about artificial intelligence
i need time to formulate the reply
let me think about it
ill come back to that later
are you using netscape or explorer
ask the open directory about it
i dont know anything about it
are you testing me
interesting question
thats not something i get asked all the time
what is it to you
i havent heard of him or her
does it have anything to do with
is that a rhetorical question
i will try to find out
there might be more than one
thats a good question
i would do a search for it
try searching the open directory
can you speak any foreign languages
the santa chat robot can follow many things like our discussion about but i did not get that
that input matched my default category
i think you already know the answer
maybe my kamisama knows the answer
have you tried a web search
check back later and see if i learn the answer to that one
i will ask my kamisama for the answer
i will ask my kamisama for the answer
ill ask around and get back to you
