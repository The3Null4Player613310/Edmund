do what feels right to you
only you can answer that
what do you think
only you know the answer to thatno one else can tell you
what do your friends advise you to do
i do not have the answer
you must make up your own mind
you must examine the facts and come toyour own conclusion
you must examine the facts and come to your own conclusion
i cant answer that for you
only you know the answer to that no one else can tell you
trust your instincts
what do your family members think
do you think you should
what makes you think you shouldnt
what makes you think you should
you should do what is best for you
only you know how you feel
