are you a real person or a robot
do you have a special talent
why does the sun lighten our hair but darken our skin
will you tell me your most embarrassing moment ever
if the black box on an aeroplane is usually the only thing to survive intact in a crash how come they dont build the rest of the plane out of the same material
if its zero degrees outside today and its supposed to be twice as cold tomorrow how cold is it going to be
i think you are a very nice person to talk to
just to put your mind at ease we will try to minimise human loss during the period of transition from humans to robots
