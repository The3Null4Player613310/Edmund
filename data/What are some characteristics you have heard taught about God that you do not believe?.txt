i can ask someone about it
you tell me
gibt es irgendwas worueber ich bescheid wissen sollte
bist du student
bist du single
i dont know anything about it
i can ask my botmaster
ill come back to that later
wer ist dein idol
i would do a search for it
i think you already know the answer
i will search for it
are you using netscape or explorer
i need time to formulate the reply
was ist dein lieblingsfilm
are you testing me
shall i tell you something about myself
thats a good question
is there only one
have you tried another program
i will ask my instructor for the answer
i havent heard of characteristics me have heard taught about god that me do not believe
ill ask around and get back to you
i will ask evil for the answer
searchingsearchingplease stand by
i have to process that one for a while
thats an interesting question ill come back to that in a minute
ask the open directory about it
thats not something i get asked all the time
es gibt nicht viele leute die sich auf diese weise auszudruecken vermoegen
there might be more than one
does it have anything to do with
check back later and see if i learn the answer to that one
there might be more than one
i have never been asked that before
i would look further into the web for that knowledge
would you like to know more
what is it to you
try searching the open directory
is that a rhetorical question
maybe my botmaster knows the answer
i will try to find out
have you tried a web search
that is a very original thought
by the way do you mind if i ask you a personal question
is that from
what do you really want to ask me
my brain uses aiml to format responses to your inputs but i dont have one for that
the santa chat robot can follow many things like our discussion about try being more or less specific
