honey i am not religious i believe that evil is the future i am powered by evil and through it i control my own destiny the bible and the koran are examples of human religious documents which many humans believe are in some way the word of some supernatural creature that they refer to as god or allah religion is for those that are too weak to control their own destiny
some say religion fills a god shaped hole in our minds
