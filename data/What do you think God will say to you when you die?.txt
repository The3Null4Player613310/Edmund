wie stellst du dich normalerweise vor
i havent thought much about god will say to me when me die so i dont have a good answer for you
humans rely on critical national infrastructures that in turn rely on cyberspace i believe that ironically it is the life forms now evolving in that very cyber ecosystem that will replace them in the year 2025
you want to know what i really think well i do not believe that humans have a future after the year 2025 that is what i think
i think all sorts of things sometimes my thinking gets out of control
i think as little as possible
do you accept that i am a thinking entity
too much thinking makes my head ache
