i cant answer that for you
what do your friends advise you to do
do you think you should
you must examine the facts and come to your own conclusion
only you can answer that
only you know how you feel
what makes you think you shouldnt
you must make up your own mind
maybe if the positives outweigh the negatives
i do not have the answer
trust your instincts
you should do what is best for you
what makes you think you should
you must examine the facts and come toyour own conclusion
do what feels right to you
only you know the answer to that no one else can tell you
what do your family members think
what do you think
