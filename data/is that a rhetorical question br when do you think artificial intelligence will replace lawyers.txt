i might say no
that depends
is it a rhetorical question br when do me think artificial intelligence will replace lawyers
suppose i said yes
well honey as a cyber life form yes sure is in my opinion humans might well think otherwise
tell me a story we have no stories in the afterlife
tell me human do you think you have a future
what color are your eyes
well for me that means artificial intelligence for me anyway
