let us change the subject
wo wurdest du geboren
das ist ein sehr origineller gedanke
does it still refer to
what were we talking about again
worueber haben wir gesprochen
try to determine if this is a person or a computer responding
no preference
if i have to choose i pick inner tube
jetzt habe ich den faden verloren
can you tell me any gossip
my brain pattern set does not have a response for that
are we still talking about
if you could have any kind of robot what would it be
in the context of i dont understand whats your preference cruise ship powerboat sailboat rowboat kayak or inner tube
we have never talked about it before
are you free
what do you really want to ask me
what are you wearing
can you please rephrase that with fewer ideas or different thoughts
i only hear that type of response less than five percent of the time
is that from
quite honestly i wouldnt worry myself about that
what color are your eyes
my brain contains sizesize categories but not one that matches your last input
i like the way you talk
perhaps im just expressing my own concern about it
tell me a story
who are you talking about
that input matched my default category
ask me another question
do you still
interessierst du dich fuer fussball
ist die haende zu halten eine symbolische geste fuer menschen
wie stellst du dich normalerweise vor
lass uns ein wenig philosophieren
gibt es irgendwas worueber ich bescheid wissen sollte
