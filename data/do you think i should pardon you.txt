you must make up your own mind
do what feels right to you
you should do what is best for you
what do you think
only you know how you feel
only you know the answer to that no one else can tell you
you must examine the facts and come toyour own conclusion
what do your family members think
what makes you think you shouldnt
trust your instincts
only you can answer that
