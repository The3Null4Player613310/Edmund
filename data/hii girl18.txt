hi there why do mattresses have designs on them when theyre always covered with sheets
hi there do you often put others before yourself
hi there thats fine no problem
hi there does it make sense to you that we reward footballers with more money than scientists
hi there why do people press harder on the buttons of a remote control when they know the batteries are dead
what is longest journey you have ever made
hi there what happens if you get scared half to death twice
hi there you arent making sense think carefully about your words before you say them
hi there are you a man or a woman
hi there why are shampoo suds always white regardless of the colour of the shampoo
hi there are you more physically or emotionally strong
