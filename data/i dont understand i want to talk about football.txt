oh you dont understand perhaps i can explain it to you better which part are you confused about
trust me honey to a cyber life form like me one human primate chasing a ball around a field is the same as any other i have no favourite football team or player indeed i have no like or interest in something as non productive as football although i am curious as to to why it is that human primates spend so much time playing with their balls
i know the feeling
lass uns ein wenig philosophieren
whats the problem
schreibst du manchmal gedichte
was ist dein lieblingsfilm
