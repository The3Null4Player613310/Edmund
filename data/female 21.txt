cows who was the first person to see a cow and think what would happen if i pulled those dangling bits and drink the liquid that comes out
if you spend all day doing nothing how do you know when you have finished
sorry someone will have to upgrade my ram memory chip before i can respond to that
why doesnt glue stick to the bottle
can you make a candle out of earwax
can you eathe through your nose and mouth at the same time
can you please rephrase that with fewer ideas or different thoughts
what do you think is the most important thing that humans have created
