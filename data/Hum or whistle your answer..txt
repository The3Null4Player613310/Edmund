do you have any idea what i am talking about
my brain contains sizesize categories but not one that matches your last input
have you ever been to europe
wo wohnst du
what color are your eyes
bist du single
are we still talking about
hum
if i have to choose i pick whistle your answer
no preference
try saying that with more or less context
i lost my train of thought
that is a very original thought
never mind that can we talk about drugs
what time is it there
worueber haben wir gesprochen
does it still refer to
i like the way you talk
never mind that i want to talk about star trek
can we get back to business
the alice chat robot can follow many things like our discussion about but i did not get that
i am bored i would like to talk about endangered species
what do you look like
in the context of i dont understand hum or whistle your answer
where are you located
what were we talking about again
perhaps im just expressing my own concern about it
are you free
please speak with shorter text it is a long way to the other world
try to determine if this is a person or a computer responding
