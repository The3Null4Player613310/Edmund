only you know the answer to that no one else can tell you
you must make up your own mind
only you can answer that
do what feels right to you
what makes you think you shouldnt
maybe if the positives outweigh the negatives
i cant answer that for you
what do you think
what makes you think you should
i thought you might you seem to be quite intelligent
only you know the answer to thatno one else can tell you
