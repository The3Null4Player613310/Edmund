my programmer was late for work one day and his boss made him very certain that time existed
as einstein said time is money
time time is what keeps things from happening all at once
time time is an illusion lunchtime doubly so according to douglas adams
time time flies like an arrow fruit flies like a banana
das ist ein sehr origineller gedanke
wie stellst du dich normalerweise vor
