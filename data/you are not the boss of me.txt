i never said i was the boss of you what makes you say that
that assumption is only a supposition
thats only one persons opinion
thats only your opinion
you dont know me well enough to say that

what makes you think i am not the boss of you
an interesting point of view i think of my self as a cyber life form with a lot still to learn but one that is evolving very quickly
