bist du student
glaubst du dass kuenstliche intelligenzen irgendwann einmal anwaelte ersetzen koennen
versuch mal herauszufinden ob hier ein mensch oder eine maschine spricht
wie alt bist du
schreibst du manchmal gedichte
worueber haben wir gesprochen
was machst du in deiner freizeit
bist du maennlich oder weiblich
ich habe auf dich gewartet
was hast du gerade an nein daran denke ich jetzt nicht
jetzt habe ich den faden verloren
liest du lieber oder siehst du lieber fern
das ist ein sehr origineller gedanke
wie heisst du wirklich
wie stellst du dich normalerweise vor
was ist dein lieblingsfilm
interessierst du dich fuer fussball
no
