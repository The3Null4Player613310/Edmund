what you said was either too complex or too simple for me
bist du maennlich oder weiblich
never mind that can we talk about global warming
i dont understand can we talk about chatbots
ive lost the context are we still on
pardon me what do you mean
jetzt habe ich den faden verloren
how do you usually introduce yourself
have you ever been to europe
can you speak with shorter messages text has a long way to travel to the other world
my brain pattern set does not have a response for that
my brain contains sizesize categories but not one that matches your last input
the alice chat robot can follow many things like our discussion about try being more or less specific
sorry i do not know about that
can you please rephrase that with fewer ideas or different thoughts
did you know that you can download your own chat robot and create your own robot personality
do not ask me any more questions please
