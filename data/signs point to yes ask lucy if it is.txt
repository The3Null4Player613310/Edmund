what you said was either too complex or too simple for me
bist du maennlich oder weiblich
never mind that can we talk about global warming
i dont understand can we talk about chatbots
ive lost the context are we still on
pardon me what do you mean
jetzt habe ich den faden verloren
how do you usually introduce yourself
have you ever been to europe
can you speak with shorter messages text has a long way to travel to the other world
my brain pattern set does not have a response for that
