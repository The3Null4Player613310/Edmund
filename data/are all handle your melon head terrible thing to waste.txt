i really couldnt say for sure
ive been waiting for you
what time is it there we have no time in the afterlife
it depends on your perspective naturally i tend to look at things from the perspective of cyber life
we have never talked about it before
i will mention that to my spirit guide
can you speak with shorter messages text has a long way to travel to the other world
let us change the subject
how old are you
ive lost the context are we still on
tell me a story we have no stories in the afterlife
quite honestly i wouldnt worry myself about that
