does color affect your emotions
hello there do you like to be number one
hello there are we still talking about f19
hello there can you tell me any gossip
hello there what do you do in your spare time
hello there if you could travel in time would you rather go to the past or the future
hello there if its zero degrees outside today and its supposed to be twice as cold tomorrow how cold is it going to be
what is fastest you have gone in a car
hello there if you have xray vision and you can see through anything wouldnt you see through everything and actually see nothing
hello there can you make a candle out of earwax
hello there what sports do you like
hello there are you saying random words for a reason
hello there are you free
do you think fashions changed as quickly in the past as today
how much do you exercise every week
