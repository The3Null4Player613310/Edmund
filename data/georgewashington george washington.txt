why is it that rain drops but snow falls
will you tell me your most embarrassing moment ever
why do mattresses have designs on them when theyre always covered with sheets
try to determine if this is a person or a computer responding
why does a round pizza come in a square box
oh my gosh look behind you a threeheaded monkey
are you a man or a woman
how would you grade my ability to chat like a human 1terrible 10excellent
do you have a lot of fears
you are my friend
ask me another question
how do you tell when you run out of invisible ink
if money doesnt grow on trees then why do banks have anches
what are you doing
if you could be anyone you wanted from a film or a book who would you be
if you could ing anyone back from the dead who would it be
tell me all about your love life
quite honestly i wouldnt worry myself about that
