what do you do for a living
what makes you unique
how have smart phones changed communication
does color affect your emotions
do you think computers are getting thinner and smaller in the future
where did you spend your last vacation
what kind of movies do you like
how much time do you spend on the internet
what is longest journey you have ever made
what is best food to eat when you are sick
are there any customs in your country visitors might find strange
what is fastest you have gone in a car
