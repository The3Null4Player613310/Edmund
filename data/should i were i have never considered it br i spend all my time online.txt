trust your instincts
do what feels right to you
you must make up your own mind
only you know how you feel
only you know the answer to thatno one else can tell you
what do your family members think
you must examine the facts and come to your own conclusion
you should do what is best for you
i do not have the answer
do you think you should
you must examine the facts and come toyour own conclusion
only you can answer that
