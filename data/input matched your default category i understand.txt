not many people express themselves that way
what were we talking about again
is the holding of hands a symbolic gesture for humans
try saying that with more or less context
are you free
oh you are a poet
are you a perfectionist
what time is it there
what color are your eyes
do you still
let us change the subject
ive been waiting for you
what you said was either too complex or too simple for me
can you please rephrase that with fewer ideas or different thoughts
